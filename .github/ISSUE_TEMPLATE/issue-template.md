I want a query that deletes a user based off a specific ID.

If the user exists then I want them to be deleted from the database and a successful response (OK 200) to be sent back to the backend.

If the user doesn't exist then I want a unsuccessful response (NOT FOUND 404) to be sent back to the backend.

If the query fails because of any other reason then I want a unsuccessful response (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR 500) to be sent back to the backend.

> The following are what the unit tests expect once development is done.

When the delete user query is ran with an id of a user that exists I **EXPECT**:
- The user to be deleted from the table and a successful code (OK 200) to be sent back.
